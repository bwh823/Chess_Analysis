# Chess_Analysis
A collection of files that I cleaned and used to conclude information about the Grand Masters, International Masters, and Candidate Masters that were registered by FIDE in 2023.

I got the initial dataset from Kaggle using this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moinulhossaindhrubo/fide-rated-players?select=fide_active_players_2023.csv 

The raw dataset is listed as 2023_gm_im_cm.csv - and the first thing that stuck out to me was that some countries were abbreviated with 3-letters while others weren't. Because I wanted some geographic element with this dataset, I want to make a uniform country column.
